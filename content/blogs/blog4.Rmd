As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist_Right <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate), createddate = mdy(createddate), timestamp = parse_date_time(timestamp, orders = "hmsdmy"))
glimpse(approval_polllist_Right)
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r trump_marginsCalc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
approval_polllist_AvgNetAp <- approval_polllist_Right %>% 
  filter(subgroup=="Voters") %>% 
  mutate(week = week(enddate), year=year(enddate)) %>% 
  mutate(Avg_Net_Approval = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(Avg_Net_Approval),
            lower = Mean - qt(0.975, 194)*sd(Avg_Net_Approval)/sqrt(n()),
            upper = Mean + qt(0.975, 194)*sd(Avg_Net_Approval)/sqrt(n())
            ) %>%
  unique(by = c("week", "year")) %>% 
   arrange(year, week)

Approval_plot <- ggplot(approval_polllist_AvgNetAp, aes(x=week,y=Mean, color = as.factor(year))) +   geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "gold")+
  labs(title = "Trump's net approval consistently negative", y = "Avg Net Approval (%)", x = "Week") + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper), linetype=1, alpha=0.1)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1, decimal.mark = '.'), 
              breaks = c(7.5, 5, 2.5,0.0,-2.5, -5.0, -7.5, -10.0, -12.5, -15.0, -17.5, -20.0))
Approval_plot
```

Comparing the confidence intervals for week 15 (6-12 April 2020) and week 34 (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what’s going on? 

While the average net approval is decreasing, the 95% confidence interval is getting larger. It could be related to Trump’s politics to combat the Covid-19 Pandemic, since those measures were quite controversial, especially if compared to what the science advised. 165/5000. With strong opinions, the way he fought the pandemic may have separated the population into two groups with opposing opinions, increasing the standard deviation of his approval.
